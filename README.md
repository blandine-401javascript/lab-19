- queue-server:   will hold your queue server, running on port 3001. It should store some object/array containing the different queues in the system. When sockets connect to this socket server, a few actions should take place:

- api server: This application will be both an Express API server running on port 3000 and a socket client connected to the queue server. It should have one primary route defined

- vendor01 and vendor 02: You will have two applications representing two different vendors.
